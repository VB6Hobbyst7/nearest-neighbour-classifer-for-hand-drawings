# nearest-neighbour-classifer-for-hand-drawings
A nearest neighbour classifier for hand-drawings, including alphanumeric characters and basic shapes. This project was programmed from scratch using no ML or machine vision libraries.

> I worked on this project during high school, in early 2019. Therefore, **the code in this repository is not representative of my current knowledge or software development abilities**. Since leaving high school and beginning my studies at the University of Manchester, I have learned a myriad of software development good practices and techniques, alongside working with far more modern programming languages. For a better demonstration of my current abilities, take a look at my work using Swift from summer 2020.

To view the project in operation, take one of the four included data set files, named 'trainingset [included data].txt', rename it to 'trainingset.txt', and place it in the same directory as a compiled executable. When debugging in Visual Studio, this can be found in the bin folder.

Datasets are included in this repository which include data from the Chars74K and MNIST datasets. All credit for this data goes to the respective owners, and has been used for educational purposes only.
